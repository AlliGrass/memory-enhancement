# Memory Enhancement Games | Languages

This is a personal project to help me in my personal journey to learning languages and 'gamifying' the memorisation process to incentivise better engagement. 

## Available Languages
Currently the program is being catered to work exclusively with Japanese, however once more games have been implemented with a better grasp on the set up of the program I will be able to implement other language options. In doing so the application can be set to mix and match languages so the primary base language doesn't have to be English. 

- Japanese (In Progress)
- Spanish (Future Development)
- Chinese (Future Development)

## Games
Each game has its own settings to determine the difficulty of the task. Users will be able to select which words/vocab they would like to work with.

- Memory Match Cards (In Progress)
- Complete the Sentence (Future Development)
- Mneumonics (Future Development / For Study)

## Vocabulary List
The current vocabulary list is based entirely on my current knowledge of the language that I have learnt from my classes. 

At this point in time the vocabulary list is hard coded into a file in the program, however in future the vocab which can be added, updated, or removed, will be intergrated into a databased, most likely using MongoDB.

Something that I will need to look into is if there are public libraries of language vocabularies to be able to automatically implement these vocabulary words into the working dictionary rather than manually inputing each word as they occur.
