# Memory Enhancement Games | Languages

This is a personal project to help me in my journey to learning languages and 'gamifying' the memorisation process to incentivise better engagement. At its current state I'm more focused on the function of the application rather than the aesthetic, however one day I will invest time to make the application more approachable and intuitive.

## Available Languages
Currently the program is being catered to work exclusively with Japanese, however once more games have been implemented with a better grasp on the set up of the program I will be able to implement other language options. In doing so the application can be set to mix and match languages so the primary base language doesn't have to be English. 

- Japanese (In Progress)
- Spanish (Future Development)
- Chinese (Future Development)

## Games
Each game has its own settings to determine the difficulty of the task. Users will be able to select which words/vocab they would like to work with.

- Memory Match Cards (On Hold | Easy Mode Functionally Complete)
- Match Grammatical Rule (Incomplete | Foundational Beginning)
- Complete the Sentence (Future Development)
- Build a Sentence (Future Development)
- Mneumonics (Future Development / For Study)

## Vocabulary List
The current vocabulary list is based entirely on my current knowledge of the language that I have learnt from my classes. Separating vocab into levels for easier control of which vocab sets to study would be beneficial for when confidence is built for the earlier vocabulary words.

I'm currently looking into intergrating a multilanguage API for easier access to new vocabulary, however with the limited API calls available I'm considering the steps to make the most of each API call. One method is to create the levelling vocab mentioned above so that each device would need to call it once and it be stored locally via cache. Another would be to call the list of vocab once and store it in a database either with SQLite or MongoDB depending on the size of the data being worked with.

- Customisable Vocab for Games (Future Development)
- Language API (In Progress)
